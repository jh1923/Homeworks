/*
 * Instructions:
	Write a short program (Main method only) which will input
	the length of the side lengths of a rectangle, and will print
	the area, perimeter, and diagonal length each on their own
	line. Make sure that each value is rounded to 2 decimal
	places if necessary, and that all values are aligned vertically.
	Use the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonals.
